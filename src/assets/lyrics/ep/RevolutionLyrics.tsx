      <span>Day after day see the images</span>
      <span>Reappear from nothing</span>
      <span>The past is tearing me apart</span>
      <span>My reflection still remains</span>
      <Break />
      <span>For salvation I cried</span>
      <span>My hands black with guilt</span>
      <span>Hasn't this already been enough?</span>
      <span>I feel like I have nothing left</span>

      <span>One breath in time, one past unite</span>
      <span>As the twilight unfolds</span>
      <span>With a fire in heart, a light in dark</span>
      <span>Rise to see your shadows, gone</span>
      <Break />
      <span>Rising up just to fall back down</span>
      <span>Last drop of hope run dry</span>
      <span>But still the fire inside your soul</span>
      <span>Refuses to subside</span>
      <Break />
      <span>Nothingess as deep</span>
      <span>As a well of despair</span>
      <span>Yet you still dare to stand defiant</span>
      <span>In the face of death</span>
      <span>(In the face of death)</span>

      <span>With a fire in heart, a light in dark</span>
      <span>Rise before oblivion and fall</span>
      <Break />
      <span>One breath in time, one past unite</span>
      <span>Open your eyes (Open your eyes)</span>
      <span>With a fire in heart, as a light in dark</span>
      <span>Rise to see your oblivion gone</span>
