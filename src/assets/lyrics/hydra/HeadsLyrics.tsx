      <span>Slobber dripping from the hell spawn waiting for me</span>
      <span>Released to bring completion</span>
      <span>We meet eye to eye, it struggles to release</span>
      <span>It's standing in the way of my ascent</span>
      <Break />
      <span>They've taken my hope</span>
      <span>Of saving this soul</span>
      <span>And left me with only one way out</span>
      <Break />
      <span>Fire coursing through me, burning all consuming</span>
      <span>The fear I evoke is orgasmic</span>
      <span>They run, try to hide</span>
      <span>No one will leave alive</span>
      <span>No force in this world will save you now</span>
      <Break />
      <span>They've taken my hope</span>
      <span>Of saving this soul</span>
      <span>And left me with only way</span>
      <span>To end this</span>
      <Break />
      <span>The waves receding slower now</span>
      <span>The rain disguising my grief from the world</span>
      <span>And the only way to see the end</span>
      <span>Is to fail now and let them win</span>
      <span>Or become the one I fear most</span>
      <Break />
      <span>They call me from below</span>
      <span>"Hell's finest, flood the world"</span>
      <span>I am summoned forth</span>
      <span>The monster, destroyer of hope</span>
      <Break />
      <span>Ten thousand years</span>
      <span>Of servitude to my masters</span>
      <span>Now I can feel finally</span>
      <span>The past closing in</span>
      <span>I will be free</span>
      <Break />
      <span>Fate has abandoned you</span>
      <span>And now it's too late</span>
      <span>You can't stop me now</span>
